# Capture the Flag

## Find a CTF
If you ever wanted to start running, you were probably encouraged to sign up to a 5k
to keep focused on a goal. The same principle applies here: pick a CTF in the near
future that you want to compete in and come up with a practice schedule. Here are
some CTFs that we can recommend:

* [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.com/) and [PlaidCTF](http://www.plaidctf.com/) by CMU
* [HSCTF](http://hsctf.com/) is made for high school students
* [Ghost in the Shellcode (GitS)](http://ghostintheshellcode.com/)
* [CSAW CTF](https://ctf.isis.poly.edu/) by NYU-Poly
* [UCSB iCTF](http://ictf.cs.ucsb.edu/) is for academics only
* [Defcon CTF](https://legitbs.net/)

Visit [CTF Time](https://ctftime.org/event/list/upcoming) and the
[CapCTF calendar](http://captf.com/calendar/) for a more complete list of CTFs
occuring every week of the year.

## How is a Wargame different?
Wargames are similar to a CTF but are always ongoing. Typically, they are organized
into levels that get progressively harder as you solve more of them. Wargames are an
excellent way to practice for CTF! Here are some of our favorites:

* [Micro Corruption](https://microcorruption.com/login)
* [SmashTheStack](http://www.smashthestack.org/)
* [OverTheWire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/)
* [Exploit Exercises](http://exploit-exercises.com/)

## What about CCDC?
The Collegiate Cyber Defense Compeition (CCDC) is a defense-only competition in
which you are tasked with defending a comically insecure system. CCDC will teach you
more about blue team (defensive) system administration than anything else (reverse
engineering, exploitation, crypto, etc). **Note** that this compeition is only for
college students.
