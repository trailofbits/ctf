# Web Exploitation
This module follows up on the previous auditing web applications module. In this module we will focus on exploiting those vulnerabilities. By the end of this module you should be comfortable identifying and exploiting the [OWASP Top 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10).

### Lecture
We covered the basics in the previous section on web security, so now we can dive into some more capable tools to achieve greater effects in this module. Learn to master Burp Suite and the Chrome Developer tools to gain a greater understanding of the applications you interact with. BeEF is an example of an XSS proxy and it will pay off to look through its source code and learn how it works.

### Workshop
You have been tasked with auditing [Gruyere](https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/), a small, cheesy web application. Gruyere is available through and hosted by Google. It includes exercises for exploiting many classes of web-specific vulnerabilities including XSS, SQL injection, CSRF, directory traversal and more. For each challenge you can find hints, exploits and methods to patch the vulnerable code.

### Tools
SQL Map and BeEF are powerful tools and very fun to play around with but ultimately not needed for the exercise. If you insist on playing with BeEF on, then please try not to hook other users auditing the application.
